                House Teas Made Locally is a tea house and internet cafe,  bringing comfort and warmth all year round through our specialty blends. Our individual and group workspaces are designed to help you maintain focus and grow your creativity, featuring ergonomic furniture and handcrafted art installations from local artists.

            Our Founders, London Rosemary, Kolt Victor, and Joseph Fulkerson come from a variety of backgrounds, but have come together to create this space surrounding their love of community, innovation, and of course, tea.

            Our tea house is home to 40 tea blends, curated from some of the most decadent ingredients from all over the world. Our team takes special care to hand blend each mix, carefully picking the right blend of flavors and infusing love into each recipe.

            As our company has grown, we felt it important to share our blends to a larger audience, leading us to expand our team and allow shipping all over the world. Donâ€™t worry, we hand package each blend with the same love and care that you know.
