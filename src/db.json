Generally, there are four Darjeeling flushes: first (between February and May), second (between May and June), monsoon (July to September), and autumn (October to November). Many black tea connoisseurs laud the flavors of second flush Darjeeling. Due to its full-bodied muscatel flavor (which is unlike any other tea in the world), the prestigious Darjeeling is also known as the Champagne of Tea.",

      "description": "On the other end of the oolong spectrum is Red Robe tea. Da Hong Pao oolongs are heavily oxidized and dark in color. This tea is revered for its health benefits and legend has it that this oolong tea saved the mother of an emperor in the Ming dynasty. Da Hong Pao has a sharp, smoky flavor that is unique among oolong teas and similar to Formosa Gunpowder black tea. It boats hints of caramel, butter, and toast. These oolong tea leaves are fat, bold strips with a slightly glossy appearance. This roasted oolong tea is typically bright orange of yellow in color. Da Hong Pao can be one of the most expensive teas in the world. The highest quality tea leaves are harvested from the original tea bushes, which are estimated to be over 1,000 years old. Da Hong Pao can cost upwards of $1,000,000 for just 1 kilogram. If money isn't an option, the highest quality Da Hong Pao oolong is considered the gold standard for serious tea lovers with deep pockets.",

      "description": "High Mountain oolong teas consist of a variety of different oolongs grown at the highest elevations in Taiwan. They are typically seasonal teas due to their production timeline. High Mountain oolongs include Alishan, Wu She, and Yu Shan. These oolongs are grown at altitudes higher than 3,300 feet and tend to grow more slowly than other oolongs. High Mountain oolong teas are harvested by hand twice per year. The leaves harvested in October are known as winter Gaoshan and the leaves plucked in June are known as spring Gaoshan. The leaves are spread out on a large tarp to dry before undergoing oxidation. As the leaves dry, they develop aromas of rose, jasmine, and geranium. Once the Gaoshan develops aroma, the leaves are folded and withered for eight hours. Tea masters then oxidize the leaves before they are sorted and packaged for sale. Gaoshan tea is generally crisp and sweet with notes of flowers or pine. The tea features a buttery aftertaste that is smooth and creamy.",

The milky flavor of Jin Xuan tea is not produced by infusing it in milk. Instead, the tea leaves naturally produce a milk-like flavor and aroma when oxidized for a certain period of time. There are some artificial milk oolongs on the market, though these are generally labeled as flavored oolongs.",
